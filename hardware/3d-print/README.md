# Depth stencil
The depth stencil is used to adjust the depth of the LED and the phototransistor
to match the printed housing before soldering.

To do this, the components are placed on the circuit board, and then the entire assembly, including the circuit board,
is placed on the depth stencil. The holes in the stencil have different diameters, so the LED and the phototransistor
must be pressed into the respective correct holes.

The depth stencil also serves as a soldering aid and can be fixed
to the table, for example, with double-sided tape.
